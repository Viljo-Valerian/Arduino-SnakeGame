# Arduino Snake Game 🐍

🏫 This is a senior project for uni. 💻

This project's objective is to create a game console with an Arduino circuit board containing a snake game that can be played with a button controller or touch screen. The game console is created through the assembly of multiple electronic components attached to the Arduino circuit board through the use of transistors, electrical wires, cables, and an LCD. We chose the snake game as it is a very popular and simple game that can be fun and challenging for people to play.

For those unfamiliar with the snake game, it involves controlling a small snake that can move in 90-degree increments. There is food scattered around the map, and the player has to control the snake to eat it to gain points. As the snake eats, it grows longer. The challenge is for us to survive and try to achieve the highest score possible in a single game session and not crash the snake into a wall or into its own body as the snake’s body gets larger from eating the food.

The full code implementation is avilable to be viewed in `SnakeGame.ino`.
